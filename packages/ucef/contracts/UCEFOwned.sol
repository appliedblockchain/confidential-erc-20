/**
 * @title UCEFOwned
 * @dev Extension for UCEF token that implements a simple owner-based authorization model.
 * In this model, only the account owner can view their own balance and related events.
 *
 * This implementation provides the strictest privacy model where each user can only
 * see their own balance and events, with no visibility into other accounts.
 *
 * Event Behavior:
 * - Transfer events: Only visible to the account owner involved in the transfer
 * - Approval events: Only visible to the token owner (not the spender)
 * - No third parties can view any events, maintaining maximum privacy
 *
 * Security considerations:
 * - Each account can only be accessed by its owner
 * - Event visibility follows the same strict owner-only model
 * - Unauthorized access attempts will revert with UCEFUnauthorizedBalanceAccess
 * - No administrative override is possible
